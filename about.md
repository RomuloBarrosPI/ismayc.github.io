I grew up in Vale, South Dakota, a town of 114 people an hour north of Rapid City.  I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology in Rapid City in 2006.  My love for the outdoors brought me to Flagstaff, AZ and Northern Arizona University where I completed my Masters in Statistics in 2008. I worked as an actuarial student at Scottsdale Insurance Company in Scottsdale, AZ prior to returning to graduate studies in 2010. 

I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at Arizona State University (ASU) in 2013.  During my time at ASU, I worked with Randall Eubank as my dissertation advisor.  My dissertation topic focused on the testing of pseudorandom numbers in a parallel computing environment.

Before moving in the summer of 2015 to start work as an Instructional Technologist/Statistical Consultant at Reed College, I was an assistant professor in the Mathematics and Computer Science Department at Ripon College in Wisconsin for two years.  Since June of 2017, I have worked in the position of Data Science Curriculum Lead for DataCamp.  I work from and am based in Portland, Oregon. 

I am interested in the use of simulation and statistical computing to improving statistics and data science education.  My passion is for working with others on statistical projects using the R computing language and on pushing for reproducible research in all aspects.  I am also interested in statistics in sports and in enhancing public awareness and knowledge of the fields of statistics and data science. I have taught many collegiate courses over the last ten years with varying roles from primary instructor to recitation/lab leader.  My love for engaging students in mathematical, computational, and statistical concepts influences my work greatly.

I enjoy cooking and spending time with my wife <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karolyn-ismay-40508028" target="_blank">Karolyn</a> and our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/figs/madison.jpg" target="_blank">golden retriever/collie mix Madison</a>.  I also like to play basketball and racquetball.
