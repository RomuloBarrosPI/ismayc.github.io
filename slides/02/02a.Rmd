## Describing Distributions {.build}

- **Shape**: modality, skewness
- **Center**: mean, median, mode
- **Spread**: variance, sd, range, IQR
- **Unusual observations**: outliers


## Shape {.build}

**Modality**

**Skewness**

<img src="../figs/skewness.png" alt="skewness" width="750">

# Plicker time!

<!--
## Shape Q

Which of these variables do you expect to be uniformly distributed?

1. weights of adult females
2. salaries of a random sample of people from Oregon
4. birthdays of classmates (day of the month)
5. Two of the above
-->

## Center: mean {.build}

What could $X$ represent?

```{r}
x <- c(8, 11, 7, 7, 8, 11, 9, 6, 10, 7, 9)
```


\[ \frac{8 + 11 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 9 + 6 + 10 + 7 + 9}{11} = \frac{93}{11} = 8.45 \\
  \\
\]

**Sample mean**: the arithmetic mean of the data (vs *pop mean*)

\[ \bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n}{n} \quad \quad \textrm{vs.} \quad \quad \mu\]

```{r}
mean(x)
```


## Center: median {.build}

**Median**: the middle value of a sorted data set.

```{r}
sort(x)
median(x)
```

Break ties by averaging middle two if necessary.


## Center: mode {.build}

**Mode**: the most frequently observed value in the data set.

```{r}
table(x)
```

```{r}
mode(x)
```


## The Typical Human

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2xOvKFFz4)

Keep note of the measures of "typical" that are reported - they come quick!


## Spread: variance {.build}

**Sample variance**: roughly, the mean squared deviation from the mean.

\[ s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}\]

Compare to the *population variance*, $\sigma^2$, which divides by $n$.


## Spread: variance {.build}

```{r}
x - mean(x)
(x - mean(x))^2
sum((x - mean(x))^2) / (length(x) - 1)
var(x)
```


## Spread: standard deviation {.build}

**Sample standard deviation**: the square root of the variance. Used because
units are the same as the data.

_Interpretation_:  Roughly, the typical difference between a value in the data set and its mean

\[ s = \sqrt{s^2} \]

```{r}
sqrt(var(x))
sd(x)
```

Compared to the *population standard deviation*, $\sigma$.


## Spread: IQR {.build}

**Inner Quartile Range**: the range of the middle 50% of the data.

\[ IQR = Q_3 - Q_1 \]

```{r IQR}
sort(x)
IQR(x)
```


## Spread: range {.build}

**Range**: the range of the full data set.

\[ range = max - min \]

```{r range}
max(x) - min(x)
range(x)
diff(range(x))
```

<!--
## Spread Q

Which measure(s) of spread would be LEAST sensitive to the presence of outliers?

2. standard deviation
3. IQR
4. Range
5. Depends on the data set
-->

## Spread Q {.build}

```{r create-y, echo=FALSE}
y <- x
y[2] <- 37
```


```{r compare_x&y}
x
y
var(x)
var(y)
```


## Spread Q {.build}

```{r distxy}
IQR(x)
IQR(y)
diff(range(x))
diff(range(y))
```


## Spread Q

Which measure(s) of spread would be LEAST sensitive to the presence of outliers?

<ol type="A">
  <li> Standard deviation </li>
  <li> IQR </li>
  <li> Range </li>
  <li> Depends on the data set </li>
</ol>

## Spread Q

Which measure(s) of spread would be LEAST sensitive to the presence of outliers?

<ol type="A">
  <li> Standard deviation </li>
  <li> <font color="green">**IQR** </font></li>
  <li> Range </li>
  <li> Depends on the data set </li>
</ol>


## Mean vs median {.build}

<img src="../figs/skew-sym.png" alt="skewsym" width="750">

The mean (red line) is sensitive to extreme values, so it gets pulled towards 
the tail. The median (dashed line) is less sensitive.

For symmetric distributions, use *mean* and *sd*.

For skewed distributions, use *median* and *IQR*.
