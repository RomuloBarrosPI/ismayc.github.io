## Spread Q

Which measure(s) of spread would be LEAST sensitive to the presence of outliers?

3. IQR
4. Range
5. Depends on the data set

## Mean vs median {.build}

<img src="../figs/skew-sym.png" alt="skewsym" width="750">

The mean (red line) is sensitive to extreme values, so it gets pulled towards 
the tail. The median (dashed line) is less sensitive.

For symmetric distributions, use *mean* and *sd*.

For skewed distributions, use *median* and *IQR*.
