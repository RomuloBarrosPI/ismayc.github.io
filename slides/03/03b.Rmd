## Considering Multiple Random Processes

- $\mathbb{P}(\text{Left}) = 0.09$, $\mathbb{P}(\text{Right}) = 0.91$
- $\mathbb{P}(\text{Blue}) = 0.15$
- These processes are
    - **independent**: knowing information about one of the variables doesn't give you
    any information about the other
- $\mathbb{P}(\text{Right and Blue}) = 0.91 \times 0.15 = `r 0.91 * 0.1365`$
- **Multiplication Rule for Independent Processes** - Let $A$ and $B$ represent events from two independent processes.
$$\mathbb{P}(A \text{ and } B) = \mathbb{P}(A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(B)$$
