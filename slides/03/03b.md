## The context

<img src="../figs/employee-theft.png" alt="theft" width="750">

## Problem Set-up

- Through accounting procedures, it is known that possibly 25% of the employees of a store are stealing.

- This classroom will act as employees and one manager.

## The manager

- First, we need a manager.

    
    ```r
    students <- c("Josephine", "Ella", "Josh", "Isabelle", "Jesse", "Toria", "Miriam", 
        "Camille", "Mauricio", "Ryan", "Margalit", "Kathleen", "Katie", "Louise", 
        "Jeannette", "Kiara")
    ```

-
    
    ```r
    sample(students, size = 1)
    ```
    
    ```
    ## [1] "Josh"
    ```


## The employees

You will need two random digits.

>- Digit 1: Last digit of your Reed ID #
>- Digit 2: Number of letters in your preferred first name

Please write these on a sheet of paper.

## Honest or thief?

To simulate 25% of retail employees being thieves, we will use your first random digit:

- If your number = 2, write "thief" above your first number.
- Otherwise, write "honest" above your first number.


## Pass or fail? {.build}

Your manager now administers a lie detector test that is 80% accurate;
there is an 80% change that thieves will fail the test and an 80% chance that 
honest folk will pass the test. Using your second random digit,

- Thieves
    - If your digit = 4, write "pass" above that digit.
    - Otherwise, write "fail" above that digit.
- Honest folk
    - If your digit = 6 or 7, write "fail" above that digit.
    - Otherwise, write "pass" above that digit.
    
    
## Moment of truth

- Who wrote "fail" on their piece of paper?  Raise your hands.

- Manager:  What percentage of these employees do you think are thieves?

- Those that raised their hands/failed to test, state whether you are honest or a thief.

- What happened here?

## Considering Multiple Random Processes

- $\mathbb{P}(\text{Left}) = 0.09$, $\mathbb{P}(\text{Right}) = 0.91$
- $\mathbb{P}(\text{Blue}) = 0.15$
- These processes are
    - **independent**: knowing information about one of the variables doesn't give you
    any information about the other
- $\mathbb{P}(\text{Right and Blue}) = 0.91 \times 0.15 = 0.12$
- **Multiplication Rule for Independent Processes** - Let $A$ and $B$ represent events from two independent processes.
$$\mathbb{P}(A \text{ and } B) = \mathbb{P}(A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(B)$$
