### Appendix A (Probability)

3. In the US population, 9% of people are left-handed and 15% of people have blue eyes. If you select an American at random, what is the probability they are right-handed and have blue eyes?
    - 0.0135
    - 0.24
    - 0.1365
    - None of the above

1. Two fair dice are rolled. What is the probability that either the sum is 8 or that at least one of the dice comes up a 6?
    - 11/36
    - 14/36
    - 15/36
    - 16/36

2. In a certain semester at some other university, 500 students enrolled in both Calculus I and Physics I. Of these students, 82 got an A in calculus, 73 got an A in physics, and 42 got an A in both courses. Which of the following probabilities is the smallest? The probability that a randomly chosen student. . .
    - Got an A in at least one of the two courses
    - Got an A in both of the two courses
    - Got an A in calculus but not in physics
    - Got an A in physics but not calculus

### Chapter 1

8. Which measure of spread would be LEAST sensitive to the presence of outliers?
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Standard Deviation</li>
      <li>IQR</li>
      <li>Range</li>
      <li>Depends on the dataset</li>
    </ol>

7. Which of these variables do you expect to be **uniformly** distributed?
    <ol type="A">
      <li>weights of adult females</li>
      <li>salaries of a random sample of people from Oregon</li>
      <li>birthdays of classmates (day of the month)</li>
      <li>Two of the above</li>
    </ol>

3. In a study reported in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine on treating warts, researchers investigated whether liquid nitrogen cryotherapy (“freezing it off”) or common duct tape would be a more effective treatment for kids with warts. The researchers randomly assigned the 51 patients to two treatment groups and found that 22 of 26 patients treated with duct tape saw complete disappearance of their warts, compared to 15 of 25 patients in the cryotherapy group. **What are the observational units?**
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Methods for wart removal</li>
      <li>Kids with warts</li>
      <li>Warts</li>
      <li>Researchers</li>
    </ol>

4. For the wart study, where researchers randomly assigned the 51 patients to two treatment groups and found that 22 of 26 patients treated with duct tape saw complete disappearance of their warts, compared to 15 of 25 patients in the cryotherapy group. **What is the explanatory variable?**
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Whether a wart completely disappeared or not</li>
      <li>The proportion of kids whose warts completely disappeared</li>
      <li>Which treatment (cryotherapy or duct tape) was used on each subject</li>
      <li>Whether or not cryotherapy and duct tape are equally effective in removing warts on kids</li>
    </ol>
    
5. In a study on treating warts, researchers investigated whether cryotherapy or common duct tape would be a more effective treatment for kids with warts. The 51 patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups and found that 22 of 26 patients treated with duct tape saw complete disappearance of their warts, compared to 15 of 25 patients using cryotherapy. **Assuming the results were statistically significant (_p_<0.05), would it be correct to conclude that duct tape caused more warts to disappear than did cryotherapy?**
    <ol type="A">
      <li>No, there could be a confounding variable.</li>
      <li>No, cause-and-effect can only be concluded from observational studies.</li>
      <li>Yes, the data clearly show an association between the treatment group and the complete disappearance of warts.</li>
      <li>Yes, this is a randomized experiment.</li>
    </ol> 
    
6. In a study on treating warts, researchers investigated whether liquid nitrogen cryotherapy (“freezing it off”) or common duct tape would be a more effective treatment for kids with warts. The researchers randomly assigned the 51 patients to two treatment groups and found that 22 of 26 patients treated with duct tape saw complete disappearance of their warts, compared to 15 of 25 patients in the cryotherapy group.  **Was this study double--blind?**
    <ol type="A">
      <li>No, the kids could tell which treatment group they were in.</li>
      <li>Yes, the students were randomly assigned to groups so double--blind is implied.</li>
      <li>Yes, the researchers did not know which treatment was being applied.</li>
      <li>There is not enough information given to decide.</li>
    </ol> 
    
1. **Match the definition with its correct term**:  The target group about which you'd like to make inferences
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Sample</li>
      <li>Population</li>
      <li>Summary statistic</li>
      <li>Anecdote</li>
    </ol>

2. **Match the definition with its correct term**: The individual unit on which you make observations
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Parameter</li>
      <li>Sample</li>
      <li>Case</li>
      <li>Census</li>
    </ol>
