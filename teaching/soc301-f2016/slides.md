- <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/soc301-f2016/slides/week-13/13a.html">2016-11-21</a>

#### Covered content

#### To do for next time

- Enjoy the Thanksgiving break!
- We'll review many of the more traditional methods of inference and how they
relate to what you've seen so far with bootstrapping, simulation, resampling, and shuffling on Monday after break.
- I'll be reading over your final project proposals and we'll be meeting in groups next week to discuss.  I'll be sending out sign-up forms over the next few days.
