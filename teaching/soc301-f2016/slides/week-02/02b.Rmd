## Next class (Wednesday) plans

- Answer questions for first 10-15 minutes to help prepare you for the quiz
- You'll have the chance to talk about anything you are struggling with in groups
- Quiz #1 testing your knowledge of using R, RStudio, and R Markdown based on the
[Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown](http://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book) book
    - First you'll take the quiz individually
    - Then we will take a break in class and you'll take the quiz in groups
    - Then we'll go over it in class
Lastly, I'll show you how to do a few more things in R

## Minute Papers

- Now that you've worked with R some, how do you plan to practice working with it more to begin studying for the quiz?

- What additional concerns do you have?  I understand they likely might not all be gone, but I'm always interested in how you think your learning is going.
