I've led many workshops on using R and R Markdown at [Reed College](www.reed.edu) for a variety of topics including

- data analysis
- statistical inference
- data visualization
- reproducible research
- senior thesis development
- interactive data visualization
- dynamic web application frameworks using `shiny`

Slides from these workshops and other projects can be found on my [RPubs.com page](www.rpubs.com/cismay).

A listing of other talks and presentations I have given can be found in my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/extras/cv-2016-01.pdf).
